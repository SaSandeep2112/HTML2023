    <h2>About the frontend developer</h2>
    <p>Each of these roles mostly encompass the same front-end development skills but require different levels of expertise in different front-end development skills. It's better to look at the job description to get an idea about the job requirements</p>
    <p>However, to give you a rough idea, if you are a complete beginner, it could take you anywhere from 3 to 6 months to get a job as an entry level frontend developer. If you are already familiar with some of the frontend technologies, it could take you anywhere from 1 to 3 months. What's important is to practice as much you can while you are learning i.e. by building as many projects as you can. You should also participate in online communities and ask for feedback from more experienced developers to accelerate your learning process.</p>
